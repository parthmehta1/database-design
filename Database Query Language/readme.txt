I have given you a jar file which can be run using following command:

'path of the jar file'>java -jar db_assignment2_v2.jar

I have also included the source code of my java code.

Also, in sir's commands that he gave us to check,
he had written Insert command as INSERT INTO Students VALUES(1,'Jason Day','1995-08-21',32);
but, we have to write INSERT INTO table Students values(1,'Jason Day','1995-08-21',32);

For your reference, the commands that are supported are:

1. CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;
2. SHOW schemas;
3. USE schema_name
4. CREATE TABLE table_name ()
5. INSERT INTO TABLE table_name VALUES();
6. SHOW TABLES
7. SELECT statements as used in mysql
8. help;
