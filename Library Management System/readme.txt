1. I have added the Library.sql file. 
We need to change the path of .CSV file that I have imported into the Library.sql file to create the tables of database.
I have included the updated .csv file into the folder. We have to change the path of this csv file to the respected table.

To run the .sql file into mysql, run the query in the following way.

source path_of_.sql file\Library.sql;


2.

To run the project, please double click the jar file named 
swing.app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The application will run automatically.


One assumption is that, the application will be run on the database that will be created by running the Library.sql file.
